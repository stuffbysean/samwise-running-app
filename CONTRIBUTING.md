- `bugfix/description` - Bug fix branches

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines below

3. **Test your changes:**
   - Run backend tests: `cd backend && npm test`
   - Test iOS app in simulator and device
   - Verify end-to-end functionality

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
